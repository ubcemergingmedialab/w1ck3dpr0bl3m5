## Premise
ORICE, Office of Regional and International Community Engagement, is creating a brand new course for UBC  called ASTU 401 G, Wicked Problems.  Wicked Problems are broad and difficult problems, like poverty and energy. ORICE is working with  partners in India that will be providing content, like narration and images, and 5 problems for students to tackle.
However, the concern is that teaching privileged students who have no experience in these complex problems creates an ethical issue. 
This is where Virtual Reality comes in. ASTU 401 G will be one of the first courses that will be integrating Google Cardboard in the classroom.  

## Aim
A team of 4 will create 8 photospheres total, so 2 photospheres per team member. The content for these photospheres will be provided by the ORICE team. 

## Contacts
**Andre Ticoulat**
He is the Research Assistant for this course and is in direct contact with their research partners in India. He will be providing photospheres, narration, audio, and text through a site called RoundMe.
