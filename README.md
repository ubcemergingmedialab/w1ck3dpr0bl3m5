# Currently working on audio

I have the audios crossfade between two given audios at the moment.

I realize that the script used will probably be changed depending on how the transition is managed in the future.

## Still need to consider
* Stopping all interview-like audios when transitioning (no fade needed)
	* Note: the background audio should still be cross fading
